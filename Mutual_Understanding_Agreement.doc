Both individuals willingly enter this agreement with the intention of building a trusting, respectful, and supportive companionship that values emotional honesty, care, and shared growth.</p>
  
  <p>This document is not a legal contract but is a heartfelt declaration of mutual promises designed to strengthen the foundation through communication, support, and genuine affection.</p>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this agreement is to nurture a relationship where both Akshay and Tapasya encourage each other's personal, emotional, and professional development while maintaining respect and understanding regardless of differences in skills, pace, or personality traits.</p>

  <h2>Key Understanding</h2>

    <li>Tapasya will support and entertain Akshay's nonsense jokes and cheap reels with enthusiasm, patience, and good humor, agreeing not to let these become a reason for disagreement or distance between them.</li>
    
    <li>Akshay, in return, commits to supporting Tapasya's ambitions, professional achievements, and emotional wellbeing with understanding and encouragement.</li>
    
    <li>Each shall respect personal space and individuality, recognizing that growth flourishes through freedom and mutual respect.</li>
